Prisoners Dilemma on Graphs

The Prisoner's Dilemma on Graphs is a discrete-time process in which each vertex is initially assigned a role (cooperator or defectors). In each round the vertices play PD with each of their neighbours. At the end of each round, vertices are given the opportunity to update their strategy according to some update scheme.

The code here provides basic functionally to run simulations of PD on a large toroidal grid.
